This repository demonstrates a potential issue in Elixir when using Enum.reduce with a conditional summation. The bug.ex file contains code that attempts to sum numbers greater than 3 in a list, but it produces an unexpected result if the list contains non-numeric values or an empty list. The bugSolution.ex file provides a corrected version of the code that handles these edge cases and provides a more robust solution. The primary issue is that the provided code lacks error handling which makes it fragile and prone to unexpected crashes.
